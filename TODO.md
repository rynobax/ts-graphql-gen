# Before Beta

handle scalars
should a nullable variable be optional?
allow custom printing hooks for custom hooks and stuff
test on real apps

# Before Release

are any directives relevant to the output types, or just ignore them?
should this attempt to determine if you don't have fragment in document?
custom errors that get printed nicely
better error message for empty graphql document
handle json schema?
